# Snowboard

We have a description and a photo (Snowboard.jpg)

I don't see anything on photo. Let's look at metadata.

Hmm that was a little weird. I knew it was easy but not this much.

Yes, just as I expected. This flag is wrong. Let's keep searching.

After the metadata, I thought of looking at their strings.

Is it a base64 code? Looks a bit suspicious. Let's decode it

Yeah flag must be this.

Flag is:
**CTFlearn{SkiBanff}**
