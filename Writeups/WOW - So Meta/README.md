# WOW... So Meta

We have a description

> This photo was taken by our target. See what you can find out about him from it. https://mega.nz/#!ifA2QAwQ!WF-S-MtWHugj8lx1QanGG7V91R-S1ng7dDRSV25iFbk

When I go to the link I see an image on the page. Then I download the image.

How about checking the metadata? I use exiftool and check photo's metadata. Flag is there (Camera Serial Number):

![METADATA](https://github.com/tunahan994/ctf-learn-writeups/edit/main/Writeups/WOW\ -\ So Meta/img/exif.png)

Flag is:

**flag{EEe_x_I_FFf}**
